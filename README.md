Glad you see you here! My name is Skylar Kurtz and I am a Senior at UMBC currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. 

5 year plan: Gather as much knowledge and experience possible so I can better create and develop all kinds of stuff from professional to recreational tools and software.
10 year plan: Secure myself in the professional work by using my skillset to help out a company 
20 year plan: I think it would be really cool to either create my own startup or start teaching computer science at a University

However the future is the future and now is now. Now I am learning a vast assortment of programming languages to see what sticks and what doesn't. I have Python (and a slew of 
modules), C(++), JavaScript, and even a bit of Ruby when I want to have fun. For the future, however, I would like to relearn Java and some other languages that have peaked my
interest.
